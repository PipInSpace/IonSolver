This software will attempt to model magnetohydrodynamic processes with magnetic field-ionized gas interactions. It uses a lattice-boltzman-model for the fluid, initial kernel functions for the LBM where taken with permission from the software [FluidX3D](https://github.com/ProjectPhysX/FluidX3D) by Dr. Moritz Lehmann.
